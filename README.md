Wiki-AI is an LLM Project, Where in you can generate summaries of Wikipedia articles through invoking openAI APIs. I used Langchain framework for prompt engineering and used vector search for slicing and generating relevant and accurate information. I used Wikipedia API for extracting data for the summary generation.
